    \nI'm going to talk about how to analyze BLAST data. And the principle is that\
    \ there is no such a thing as putting your data into a machine and expecting to\
    \ get an answer. The type of analysis you make is always related to the question\
    \ you're asking.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at https://ocw.mit.edu/terms\n\
